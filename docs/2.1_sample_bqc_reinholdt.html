Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Korstanje-OConnor_Workflow/tree/c8b2d371fe962018d6921b8325e9a771a50753ea" target="_blank">c8b2d37</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p>This script is running genotype QC on raw data (with some outcomes already seen in the <a href="summary.html">project at a glace</a>). Here, we first load the R/qtl2 package and the data. We’ll also load the R/broman package for some utilities and plotting functions, and R/qtlcharts for interactive graphs.</p>
<p>We will follow the steps by <code>Karl Broman</code> found <a href="https://kbroman.org/qtl2/assets/vignettes/do_diagnostics.html">here</a></p>

<p>In the above scatterplot, we show the proportion of hets vs the average intensity for the X chromosome SNPs. In calculating the proportion of heterozygous genotypes for the individuals, we look at X chromosome genotypes equal to 2 which corresponds to the heterozygote) relative to not being 0 (which is used to encode missing genotypes). The genotypes are arranged with rows being individuals and columns being markers.</p>
<p>The following are the mice that have had sex incorrectly assigned:</p>
